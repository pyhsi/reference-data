# How to contribute [DRAFT]

This repository is for discussing the format and content of data products that the TERRA Reference team will produce.

Most of the discussions occur in the form of [GitHub issues](https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/issues). You can ask questions, request new or updated data products, and propose new formats to support there by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/issues/new).

## Proposing new data products

Ideally these will be accompanied by open source scripts, code snippets, or pull requests to modify / extend scripts in the https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline repository.

## Requesting support for / integration with existing data formats

We have a long list of APIs, databases, and data formats that we plan to ingest, process, and provide access to through the TERRA Ref platform. These are listed in the documentation <!--todo more details here and in documentation-->

## Requesting changes to existing data products

If using our data, please let us know how you access it, and what works / doesn't work.


## Code of Conduct

Harassment in code and discussion or violation of physical boundaries is completely unacceptable anywhere in TERRA-REF’s project codebases, issue trackers, chatrooms, mailing lists, meetups, and other events. Violators will be warned by the core team. Repeat violations will result in being blocked or banned by the core team at or before the 3rd violation.

###In detail
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Maintainers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, including maintainers, we may take appropriate action, up to and including warning the offender, deletion of comments, removal from the project’s codebase and communication systems, and escalation to GitHub support.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the core team or email dlebauer@illinois.edu immediately.

We expect everyone to follow these rules anywhere in TERRA-REF's project codebases, issue trackers, chatrooms, and mailing lists.

Finally, don't forget that it is human to make mistakes! We all do. Let’s work together to help each other, resolve issues, and learn from the mistakes that we will all inevitably make from time 

###Thanks
Thanks to the [Fedora Code of Conduct](https://getfedora.org/code-of-conduct) and [JSConf Code of Conduct](http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html).
