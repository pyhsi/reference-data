# February 2016 Trait Data Standards Committee Meeting

## Participants

Max Burnette, Noah Fahlgren, David LeBauer, David Lee, Cheryl Porter, Geoff Morris, Shawn Serbin, Mitch Tuinstra, Jeffrey White, 

## Topics


### [Agronomic Meta-data Formats](https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/issues/18)

* [Core experimental meta-data for NARN (draft)]( https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/files/15501/Core.Harmonized.Crop.Experiment.Data_JWW_chp.docx)
* Cheryl: please comment about the relationships between ICASA and NARDN-HD, scope of NARDN
* How does this interact with [Brapi API](http://docs.brapi.apiary.io/#introduction/structure-of-the-response-object)? used by FieldBook, BMS?

### Shared Field Measurement Protocols

* Darwin Campbell will give quick overview of genomes2fields project
  * G2F has simple protocols for a core set of five traits that everyone measures. Also spreadsheet templates and instructions for collecting data.
* FieldBook field measurements don't say _how_ to measure, but provide a framework for collecting the data.

### Core Traits?

Some being discussed:

* Biomass (time series)
* Canopy Architecture (emergence, % cover, LAI, leaf angle, leaf length, leaf number, leaf width)
* Transpiration (and leaf temperature)
* Tissue Chemistry carbohydrates, lignin, N
* Photosynthesis: pigments
