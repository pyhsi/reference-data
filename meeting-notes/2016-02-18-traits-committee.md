# February 2016 Trait Data Standards Committee Meeting

## Participants

Max Burnette, Noah Fahlgren, David LeBauer, David Lee, Cheryl Porter, Geoff Morris, Mitch Tuinstra, Jeffrey White, Jack Gardiner

## Agenda

### ICASA / NARDN

Cheryl Porter will present information aboutu ICASA, NARDN, USDA efforts at database harmonization

* [Core experimental meta-data for NARDN (draft)]( https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/files/15501/Core.Harmonized.Crop.Experiment.Data_JWW_chp.docx)

### Genomes2Fields 

* Darwin Campbell will give quick overview of genomes2fields project
  * G2F has simple protocols for a core set of five traits that everyone measures. 
  * Also spreadsheet templates and instructions for collecting data.
  * Integration with [BMS](https://www.integratedbreeding.net/) and [GOBII](http://www.gobiiproject.org/) (Jack Gardiner if available)

### FieldBook and BRAPI

Field measurements provide a framework for collecting the data

## Discussion

### Shared Field measurement protocols

Has been requested by many of the TERRA teams. Who has protocols to start with? What are priority traits?


Some being discussed within the TERRA Ref team:

* Biomass (time series)
* Canopy Architecture (emergence, % cover, LAI, leaf angle, leaf length, leaf number, leaf width)
* Transpiration (and leaf temperature)
* Tissue Chemistry carbohydrates, lignin, N
* Photosynthesis: pigments

### Many databases: Interoperability

* [Brapi API](http://docs.brapi.apiary.io/#introduction/structure-of-the-response-object)? used by FieldBook, BMS?
* [BETYdb](www.betydb.org)
* BMS
* GOBII

What is the framework for linking these resources?
