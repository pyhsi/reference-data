* [Core experimental meta-data for NARN (draft)]( https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/files/15501/Core.Harmonized.Crop.Experiment.Data_JWW_chp.docx)
* Cheryl: please comment about the relationships between ICASA and NARDN-HD, scope of NARDN
* How does this interact with [Brapi API](http://docs.brapi.apiary.io/#introduction/structure-of-the-response-object)? used by FieldBook, BMS?

### Shared Field Measurement Protocols

* genomes2fields has simple protocols for a core set of five traits that everyone measures. Also spreadsheet templates and instructions for collecting data.
* FieldBook field measurements don't say _how_ to measure, but provide a framework for collecting the data.
